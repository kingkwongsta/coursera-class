      <p>
        Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean
        restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist.
        The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and
        have a menu of 12â€“15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant
        has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a
        popular place for a meal any time of the day.

        Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who
        moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a
        restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his
        experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the
        restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian
        to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
